# Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to MaxCut problem
## A simple simulation using Qiskit

## Description
In this project I applied the QAOA to the MaxCut problem which aims to find the maximum cut of a graph.
This program builds the QAOA quantum circuit using Qiskit and simulates it using the AerSimulator which is provided by
Qiskit-aer. One can apply any graph to this problem if wanted.
The main file creates different plots and visualizations of the
performance (qualitatively) of this QAOA implementation using different parameters and different sized graphs as input.
In `visualizations`, images used for explaining the algorithm can be generated.

## Usage
The project was developed and tested using Python version `3.11.4`, newer versions are not tested and might not be compatible with some
dependencies.
